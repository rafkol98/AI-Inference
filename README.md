Bayesian Belief networks (BNs) are a way of representing probabilistic relationships among a
set of variables. They constitute an effective systematic way to represent uncertain representation of the world.
Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models representing a set of random variables
and their conditional dependencies via directed acyclic graphs. They have
important applications in diagnostic expert systems particularly for medical applications, investigation of faulty systems, and legal domains.

In this practical I developed my own Bayesian Network system from scratch, for predicting the risk
of digital security attacks for a company network.
